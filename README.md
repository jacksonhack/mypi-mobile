## MyPi Pizza Order Generator Mobile App

This is a mobile app that generates ideal pizza orders for a large group of people. It is designed to be used by a host who creates an order, and then the guests can join the order and add their own toppings preferences. The host can then generate a pizza order that is ideal for the group.

This app is built using React Native and can be run on both iOS and Android devices using Expo.
